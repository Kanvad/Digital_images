# Lab 2

This lab explores image processing techniques using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Notebook

- [lab2.ipynb](lab2.ipynb): Contains the code and explanations for the lab exercises.

## Instructions

1.  Open the `lab2.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2.  Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the exercises.
3.  Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed (e.g., NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib). You can install them using pip:

    \`\`\`bash
    pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
    \`\`\`

## Images

This lab uses the following images:

- baby.jpeg
- balloons_noisy.png
- flower.jpeg

These images are located in the `Lab2/exercise/` directory.

## Output Images

The output images generated by the notebook are stored in the `Lab2/` directory.

## Random HSV Color Images Specific

The denoised random HSV images are stored in the `Lab2/Random_HSV_Color_Images_Specific/` directory.

## Notebook Sections

### 6. Denoising Filters

This section applies different denoising filters (mean, median, maximum, and minimum) to the images in the `exercise` directory. It then displays the filtered images using Matplotlib. The output of this section is a set of images with different denoising filters applied, saved in the `Lab2/` directory. The goal is to visually compare the effectiveness of each filter in reducing noise.

### 7. Edge Detection Filters

This section applies edge detection filters (Sobel, Prewitt, Canny, and Laplace) to the denoised images. The denoising is done using the median filter. The output is a set of edge-detected images saved in the `Lab2/` directory. The purpose is to identify the edges in the images after noise reduction.

### 8. Random RGB Color Change

This section changes the RGB colors of the images randomly after applying a median filter for denoising. The output is a set of images with random RGB color changes, saved in the `Lab2/` directory. The aim is to explore the effect of random color changes on the images.

### 9. Random HSV Color Change

This section changes the HSV colors of the images randomly after applying a median filter for denoising. The output is a set of images with random HSV color changes, saved in the `Lab2/` directory. The goal is to explore the effect of random HSV color changes on the images.
